### Website Presentation

##### GRN-Vtool is a website that allows biologists to run many GRN tools, in our website you we aid for:
- Efficient GRN studies that save biologists from many technical difficulties.
- Presenting the result of different tools in one-place where the similarities and differences are automatically highlighted helps biologists to conduct efficient comparative analysis.
- Providing the biologists with an interactive network where they can click on genes to get extra information will help the biologist to get further insight on the results.
- Making the Search process easier were it will help the biologist to navigate in large network.
- Partial network extraction will aid them for productive analysis. 

     
#### You can use Two tools in the Website to generate your network [SeqNet](https://github.com/tgrimes/SeqNet),[DIANE](https://github.com/OceaneCsn/DIANE).
